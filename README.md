Documentation for the Code
This program generates AI-based images using a text prompt, leveraging the Stable Diffusion model for text-to-image generation. It incorporates Gradio for creating an interactive user interface to input text prompts and display the resulting images.

Components and Dependencies
Libraries Used:

torch: PyTorch is used for loading the pre-trained model and running inference.
diffusers: The StableDiffusionPipeline from the diffusers library is used to generate images based on text prompts.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for image processing and saving the output.
gradio: A library for creating user interfaces for machine learning applications.
Functions in the Code:

generate_image(prompt: str, output_path: str, num_inference_steps: int = 50, guidance_scale: float = 7.5) -> Image:

This function generates an image based on the provided text prompt using the Stable Diffusion model.
Parameters:
prompt: The text prompt describing the desired image.
output_path: File path where the generated image will be saved.
num_inference_steps (optional): The number of steps used in the inference process. More steps can improve image quality but increase computation time.
guidance_scale (optional): A higher value increases the prompt's impact on the generated image, guiding the model to generate images closer to the text description.
Returns: A PIL Image object representing the generated image.
generate_image_interface(prompt: str) -> Image:

This function serves as an interface for Gradio, calling generate_image() and returning the generated image to be displayed in the Gradio interface.
Parameter: prompt is a string containing the text description of the desired image.
Returns: A PIL Image object for Gradio to display.
Main Execution Block (if __name__ == "__main__":)

Initializes a Gradio interface with the following components:
fn: The function to execute when the interface is used (generate_image_interface).
inputs: Specifies that the input is a text field ("text").
outputs: Specifies that the output is an image ("image").
title: Title of the Gradio application ("Urban Heat Island Impact Generator").
description: A brief description of the interface.
examples: Predefined example prompt for users to try out.
The Gradio interface is then launched, allowing users to interactively generate images.
Technologies and Algorithms Used
Stable Diffusion (Diffusion Model):

The program uses a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model from the CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 checkpoint, a deep learning model that generates images from textual descriptions.
Diffusion Models: These are generative models that learn to reverse a process that adds noise to data (like images). Starting from pure noise, the model iteratively refines the image based on the input prompt.
Guidance Scale: Controls how much the model is influenced by the prompt during image generation. Higher values can make the model follow the prompt more closely but may reduce diversity in the generated image.
PyTorch:

A deep learning framework that provides support for tensor computations and automatic differentiation, enabling efficient model training and inference.
Gradio:

An open-source library for building web-based interfaces for machine learning models, making it easy to interact with the model and visualize results.
Provides a simple way to create a GUI for the program, allowing non-programmers to use the model by entering text prompts and viewing the generated images.
Autocasting with PyTorch:

The use of torch.autocast allows for mixed precision training and inference, which can improve performance by using lower precision (like float16) on GPUs, if available.
Conditional Sampling Algorithm:

In diffusion models, conditional sampling is used to generate images based on specific conditions, like text prompts. The guidance scale adjusts how strictly the model adheres to the prompt during the reverse diffusion process.
Example Usage
Run the code in a Python environment that supports Gradio and has a GPU available (for better performance).
Launch the Gradio interface to interactively generate images by entering prompts. For instance, the given example describes "The Rise of Heat Islands in Urban Areas and Their Impact on Public Health," visualizing the effects of heat in urban settings.
System Requirements
Python environment with the following packages installed: torch, diffusers, PIL, and gradio.
A GPU is recommended for faster image generation, but CPU-only inference is possible (albeit slower).
